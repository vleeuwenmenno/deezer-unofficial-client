<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I like sharing what music I listen. So I made this simple client that shares the music I currently play in Deezer. It stops sharing as soon as you pause your music or close the player.

### Libraries & resources used

* [Electron.NET](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET)
Used as UI framework for Linux, this is an important part of this application.

* [Deezer](https://deezer.com/)
Where you get your music to play from.
